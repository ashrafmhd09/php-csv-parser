= Method:cell = 

_ cell fetcher _

gets the value of a specific cell by given coordinates

Note: That indexes start with zero, and headers are not
searched!

For example if we are trying to grab the cell that is in the
second row and the third column



*Code*
{{{
name,age,skill
john,13,knows magic
tanaka,8,makes sushi
jose,5,dances salsa
}}}


we would do something like


*Code*
{{{
var_export($csv->cell(1, 2));
}}}


and get the following results


*Code*
{{{
'makes sushi'
}}}


  # *Argument* _integer_  $x the row to fetch
  # *Argument* _integer_  $y the column to fetch

  * *Visibility*  public
  * *Returns* mixed|false the value of the cell or false if the cell does
not exist
  * *Also see* headers(), coordinateable(), row(), rows(), column()
